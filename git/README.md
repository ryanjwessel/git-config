# Git Configuration

Your `.gitconfig` file is located in the `$HOME` directory. On MacOS, this is normally something like `/Users/<your-user-name>`.

Simply make edits to this file and copy it to that directory for this to take effect. Make sure you have updated all references to my name and email address to use yours instead.

Note, this is a globally shared configuration file, so it will affect all projects.
