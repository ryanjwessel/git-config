# ZSH Configuration

I love using [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) because it has a great ecosystem of plugins that make my life easier. Mainly, syntax highlighting and autocomplete in the shell.

Instructions for installing Oh My Zsh can be found [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation).

The files in this directory can be copied into your `$HOME` directory, where a `.zshrc` file should already exist. 

This configuration is more specific than some of the other tools I use. I have a custom prompt, I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), and have things like Java, Gradle, and Ruby Version Manager for mobile app development. Maybe I will clean this up so it is more generally usable. Or maybe I won't! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
