# iTerm Instructions

This file contains a config file in the `iterm_config` directory that can be imported directly by iTerm. This can be set by going to `Preferences > General > Preferences` and setting "Load preferences from a custom directory or URL" to the `iterm_config` directory (or this GitHub URL, I haven't tried that).

## Install Themes

See [iterm2colorschemes.com](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/) for other theme options, and for more detailed instructions on how to install them.

The themes I like are included in this directory, and can be imported from the `Color Presets` dropdown menu in `Preferences > Profiles > Colors`.
