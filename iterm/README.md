# iTerm Instructions

This only contains themes at the moment. I have made some customizations with my tabs and status bar, but I am not sure how those could be imported from a file (if at all).

## Install Themes

See [iterm2colorschemes.com](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/) for other theme options, and for more detailed instructions on how to install them.

The themes I like are included in this directory, and can be imported from the `Color Presets` dropdown menu in `Preferences > Profiles > Colors`.
